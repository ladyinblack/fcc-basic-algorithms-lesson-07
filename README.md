### [Repeat a String Repeat a String](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/repeat-a-string-repeat-a-string)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
The program is very simple, we have ot take a variable and return that variable being repeated certain amount of times.  No need to add space or anything, just keep repeating it into one single string.

## HINTS
### Hint 1
You can't edit strings, you will need to create a variable to store the new string.
### Hint 2
Create a loop to repeat the code as many times as needed.
### Hint 3
Make the variable created store the current value and append the word to it.

### Code Explanation (of Solution as ABOVE)
- Create an empty string variable to store the repeated word.
- Use a `for` loop to repeat each code as many times as needed according to `num`.
- Then we add the string to the variable created on step one inside of the loop.
- At the end of the loop, return the variable for the repeated word.
